## RequireJS and BackboneJS Starter
This application is a starting point to design a modular application using RequireJS, and BackboneJS.  

The build.bat file in the js directory also has scripts to run to build the application with either NodeJS, or Java.  

There are simple examples of how to write a router, view, and model.  

Feel free to fork and use in your own BackboneJS app!!
